## Testing Guidelines

- All new features and bug fixes should include tests
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) when appropriate
- Test files should be placed in `__tests__` directories
- Test files should be named `ComponentName-test.tsx` or `ServiceName-test.ts`
- Use Jest as the testing framework
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Create helper functions for commonly reused test code
- Apply DRY principles to test code
- Focus coverage on core business logic and critical paths
- Run `npm run test:coverage` to check test coverage
- Aim for at least 80% coverage for critical service code
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

### Running Tests with Mocks

- Run specific tests with configuration file: `npm test hooks/__tests__/useThemeColor-test.ts -- --config=jest.config.js`
- Mock modules are defined in the `/__mocks__` directory:
  - `/__mocks__/asyncStorageMock.js` - Simulates AsyncStorage
  - `/__mocks__/useColorSchemeMock.js` - Simulates React Native's useColorScheme
- The Jest config maps module paths to mocks:
  ```javascript
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/asyncStorageMock.js",
    "react-native/Libraries/Utilities/useColorScheme": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/useColorSchemeMock.js"
  }
  ```

## API Communication
- All HTTP requests use the unified `HttpUtil.performRequest()` method
- Standard logging for all requests including:
  - Request URL, method, headers, and body
  - Response status, headers, and body
  - Request/response timing
  - Curl command generation for debugging
- Secure handling of sensitive information (tokens are automatically redacted)
- Request IDs are used for request tracking and correlation:
  - Every request automatically gets a unique X-Request-ID header
  - API errors include the Request ID for easier debugging
  - The ApiService.handleApiResponse method provides consistent error handling with Request IDs
  - Error messages in the UI include Request IDs in development mode
- Error handling best practices:
  - Use the ApiError interface for typed error handling
  - Always extract and include Request IDs in error messages
  - Use meaningful user-facing error messages instead of fallback data
  - Follow the DRY principle with shared error handling methods
- Mock data mode with detailed logging:
  - Use `ApiService.enableMockDataMode(mockToken, mockServerUrl)` to enable
  - Mock requests and responses are logged with ðŸ”¶ visual markers
  - Mock requests use the same logging format as real requests
  - Detailed logging only shown in development mode
  - Simulated curl commands for mock requests are generated
  - Great for testing without a real server or in demo mode
- Graph API endpoints follow Microsoft Graph API structure
  - User information: `/graph/v1.0/me?$expand=memberOf`
  - Drives/spaces: `/graph/v1.0/drives`

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Follow React Native / Expo best practices with file-based routing (expo-router)
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Organize imports: React first, then external libraries, then local imports
- Use named exports rather than default exports where appropriate
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `LoginScreen`, `FileList`)
  - Functions/variables: camelCase
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Handle errors with try/catch and appropriate user feedback
- Use path aliases (@/* instead of relative imports) for cleaner imports
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Store tests in `__tests__` directories with naming pattern `ComponentName-test.tsx` or `ServiceName-test.ts`
- Write meaningful comments for complex logic
- When ESLint indicates unused variables or imports:
  - If they'll be needed in the future or are implicitly used, keep them with appropriate comments
  - Add explanatory ESLint-disable comments to document why rules are ignored
  - Example: `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`
- When excluding useEffect dependencies:
  - Document the reason with clear comments explaining the decision
  - Example: `// loadData is intentionally excluded to only load on mount`

## Theming
- The app uses a dynamic theming system supporting 3 modes: Light, Dark, and System
- Theme state is managed through React Context in `/context/ThemeContext.tsx`
- Theme persistence uses AsyncStorage to remember user preferences between sessions
- Color definitions are in `/themes/colors.ts` with matching props in both themes:
  - Base colors: text, background, tint, etc.
  - UI Elements: surface, surfaceVariant, border, etc.
  - Status colors: success, warning, error, info
  - Button variants: regular, disabled, etc.
- Access theme colors using the `useThemeColor` hook:
  ```typescript
  const themeColors = colors[effectiveTheme];
  ```
- For dynamic styling, use style arrays with theme values:
  ```typescript
  <Text style={[styles.title, { color: themeColors.text }]}>Title</Text>
  ```
- Proper fallbacks are implemented for when themes change or system theme is used

## Authentication
- The app uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) with WebFinger discovery
- Authentication flow:
  1. WebFinger discovery: `/.well-known/webfinger` endpoint
  2. OIDC configuration: `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint
  3. Authorization in browser
  4. Redirect back to app
  5. Token exchange
- Platform-specific client IDs:
  - iOS: `OpenCloudIOS`
  - Android: `OpenCloudAndroid`
- Platform-specific redirect URIs:
  - iOS: `oc://ios.opencloud.eu`
  - Android: `oc://android.opencloud.eu`
- URL schemes must be registered in:
  - iOS: `/ios/opencloudmobile/Info.plist`
  - Android: `/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

## Configuration
- Central configuration in `/config/app.config.ts`
- Platform-specific settings using React Native's `Platform.OS`
- Configuration categories:
  - `auth`: Authentication settings (client IDs, redirect URIs, scopes)
  - `api`: API communication settings (timeouts, logging, headers)
- Logging configuration:
  - `maxBodyLogLength`: Maximum number of characters to log for request/response bodies
  - `generateCurlCommands`: Automatically enabled in development mode, generates curl commands for API requests
  - `enableDebugLogging`: Automatically enabled in development mode, provides detailed logs
- Import configuration in components:
  ```typescript
  import { authConfig, apiConfig } from '../config/app.config';
  ```

## Git Workflow & Best Practices

### Branch Strategy
- Create feature branches from `main` branch
- Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
  - `feature/feature-name` for new features
  - `fix/issue-name` for bug fixes
  - `docs/topic-name` for documentation updates
  - `refactor/component-name` for code refactoring
  - `test/component-name` for adding/improving tests

### Pull Request Process
1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature main
   ```

2. **Make changes** and run tests locally:
   ```bash
   npm test
   # or for specific tests
   npm run test:fast -- path/to/test.ts
   ```

3. **Commit changes** with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature X that does Y to solve Z"
   ```

4. **Push changes** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request** via GitHub UI
   - Add a descriptive title and detailed description
   - Reference any related issues with `#issue-number`
   - GitHub Actions will automatically run tests on your PR

6. **Wait for CI checks** to pass:
   - Tests (Jest)
   - Code coverage thresholds
   - Linting rules

7. **Request reviews** from team members

8. **Address review feedback** with additional commits

9. **Merge only when**:
   - All tests pass in GitHub Actions
   - Code coverage thresholds are met (currently 80%)
   - PR has been approved by at least one reviewer
   - All discussions are resolved

10. **Delete branch** after merging

### Important Rules
- Never push untested code directly to `main`
- Always use pull requests for code changes
- Prefer small, focused pull requests over large ones
- Update tests alongside code changes
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Document new features in appropriate documentation files

## Security Practices
- Dependencies are regularly updated to fix security vulnerabilities
- Main project uses latest compatible versions of Expo and React Native
- Documentation site uses Docusaurus v3 with current dependencies
- Run `npm audit` periodically to check for new vulnerabilities
- For low risk vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies that cannot be fixed, review case-by-case
- Security updates should be prioritized over feature development
